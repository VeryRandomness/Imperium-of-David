On your way to [[Triboar]] you had two different run ins with very interesting people. The first was with [[The Gypsies]] who let you stay with them for the night and were gone without a trace the next morning. The next person was the [[Fortune Teller]] who gave you [[The Fortune]]. As you got closer to [[Triboar]] you saw smoke rising into the air. When you arrived you saw the town was on fire.
