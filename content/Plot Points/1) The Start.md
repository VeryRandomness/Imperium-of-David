As you were traveling down Saratoga Rd. in Jacks Jeep Grand Cherokee, you hit something big and furry causing you to spin out. You then went through a portal that teleported you to a fantasy world.

You saw smoke in the distance and decided to drive the car to where the smoke was coming from. Arriving where the smoke emanated from you realized it was a small collection of buildings called [[Stathford]]. Going to the inn, you attempted to buy some food but had no money it was as this point you met [[David son of David]]. The town blacksmith came bursting through the door and asked you to go save his daughter.
