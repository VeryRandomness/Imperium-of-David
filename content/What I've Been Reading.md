I just finished *The Moon is a Harsh Mistress* by Robert Heinlein. This Sci-fi book set in the near future on Earth's largest satellite the Moon. It is told through the eyes of Manny, a one armed computer repair man turned revolutionist. This book shows the tyranny of a distant government, the power of computers, and the beautiful idea of TANSTAFL! 

4 out of 5 stars!
