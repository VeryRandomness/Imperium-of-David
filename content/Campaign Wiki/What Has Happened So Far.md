Arriving where the smoke emanated from you realized it was a small collection of buildings called [[Stathford]]. Going to the inn, you attempted to buy some food but had no money it was as this point you met [[David son of David]]. The town blacksmith came bursting through the door and asked you to go save his daughter.
