**To the Cunning Tusk Tribe,**

Greetings, my devious allies. As you know, our last attempt to summon The Knower was thwarted by those who would see our plans undone. It is now your turn to take up the mantle of vengeance and seek out these interlopers. Avenge the death of your sister tribe The Gloomshank Tribe.

Your task is simple yet vital: locate the ones responsible for this insult to our power, subdue them, and bring them to me. Alive or dead, I do not care. Use your wits and stealth, for the shadows are our allies.

Once you bring these disruptors to me, I will award you greatly. Things of this world are of no consequence to me or my master. All your wishes will be granted.

Be swift! We cannot afford another failure like The Gloomshanks; our ambitions hang in the balance. If you fail me, my masters retribution will be fast and destructive.

Move swiftly and silently and remember: the fate of our future depends on your cunning strength.

In darkness,

**Dead Hand**
