**To the Esteemed Shaman Grimthorn,**

In the shadows where power stirs, I, Dead Hand, extend these words to you with gravity. The hour approaches when we must summon The Knower, that ancient being whose wisdom is unparalleled. It is imperative that you understand the significance of the ritual at hand.

You are no stranger to the threads of fate that bind us, yet I must emphasize that failure to perform this ritual will not only set you back in your endeavors but will also draw my ire! The power to summon The Knower can only be harnessed through meticulous preparation and unwavering commitment. Any misstep will result in a delay that could cost us dearly, and I assure you, my patience wears thin.

Let me be clear: should you falter in this sacred task, I will not hesitate to bring retribution upon you and your entire clan. My hand is swift, and your life will be forfeit should you prove unworthy of our covenant. The forces I seek to command are not to be trifled with, and your failure will not only doom your kin but also seal your fate at my own hand.

The ritual must commence under specific circumstances, as dictated by our ancient texts. Gather the necessary "volunteer" from the neighboring settlement and ensure your tribe is prepared to lend their strength. The time for hesitation has passed; now is the moment to demonstrate your worth.

I await your prompt action.

For the glory of The Knower,

**Dead Hand**
