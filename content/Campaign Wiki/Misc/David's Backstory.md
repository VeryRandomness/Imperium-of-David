I was in charge of Waterdeep's 7th battalion, The Death Formation. We were the best battalion in the war against The Seven Hells. Towards the end of the war my battalion was stationed in a town just West of The Breach. Our intel said that there was going to be a small squad of lesser devils coming through The Breach in a few days and we were to defend the town.

Hours before what would be called The Culling I received a communication from Neverwinter High Command saying that a whole brigade of demons and devils were going to come through The Breach and that I was to abandon the town and retreat back to Neverwinter to fortify the capitol. I couldn't do that to the town. I couldn't do that to her.

I told my men about the new orders and said that if any of them wanted to return to Neverwinter and protect the Lord Superior they would have my respect and would be good soldiers for following orders. Not one of my men left. They would rather die than be labeled a coward.

I was able to get the Wood Fae help evacuate the old, the sick, the women, and children. Those that would evacuate.

We guessed that the fiends of Hell would attack the city on the East side so we hide the remaining townspeople in the west half. Right as we finished our preparations we saw the first of them. These purple man-like creatures. Then more grotesque demons. They hit our defenses like a tidal wave. Despite their unstoppable will we held them off. For a bit.

For five days we halted their advancement. Then they broke through. In the span of 30 minutes the forces of Hell killed 100 of my men. Every day after they killed more and more of us. 

We started forcibly evacuating the townspeople with the help of the Wood Fae the day they broke through. We weren't fast enough. By the 7th day there was only 4 of my men left, defending the last townspeople as they were being evacuated. The 4 bravest people I ever knew. Our mage, Lacri, cast a portal spell as a devil impaled him with a barbed spear. One of my lieutenants, Durnala held of 3 demons at once while a child she had been caring for ran through the portal. When she saw her foundling reach safety she cast an ice spell, centered on herself, taking out not only the 3 demons she had been fighting, but also 4 others in the area. I last saw Herbalar Nose Smasher, our goliath barbarian, taking on 7 demons bare handed with huge wounds in his side. Only his rage kept him alive, until they overpowered him. He took out 15 of those devils before they brought him down. Only me and my number two were left. We were constantly on our heels moving to the portal, protecting the last two towns people. 

We were only 10 feet from the portal, flickering in and out of existence, when a sword stabbed into my number 2, Dolgu Frarhle. He feel to the ground clutching the wound. I grabbed Dolgu and turned to grab the last townsperson who hadn't evacuated, Jes, the most beautiful woman I had ever seen. An arrow hit her in the chest as I grabbed her and threw her and Dolgu through the portal, myself following just after throwing and explosive rock on the ground.

Jes... Jes died later that day.

From a battalion of 950 men, only two made it out. After we pushed the demons back to the Seven Hells, Dolgu and I were given medals of honor. Medals we didn't earn. We knowingly disobeyed orders. We caused the deaths of hundreds of the best soldiers to ever have fought in Faer√ªn. I caused the death of my betrothed by not forcing her to evacuate earlier.

After the ceremony Dolgu and I got in a fight and traded blows before city guards broke it up and threw us in Neverwinter hold for a few days. Dolgu got out first, his family is related to the King of the Dwarves and they pulled some strings with The Lord Superior to get him released. I haven't seen him since.
