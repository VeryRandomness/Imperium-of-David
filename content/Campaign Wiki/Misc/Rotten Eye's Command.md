To the Honorable War Chiefs,

In the all knowing sight of The Secret Keeper, I, Rotten Eye, address you with words of grave importance. The mortals who dared to thwart our summoning of The Secret Keeper have not only disrupted our plans but continued to evade capture. This insult cannot go unanswered.

You, commanders of legions of the fiercest, understand the weight of failure and the inexcusable nature of insults. I call upon you now to send forth your most relentless hunters. These mortals must be captured, alive or dead, so that the world sees the consequence of defying the The Secret Keeper.

Our sources tell us that they are in Longsaddle. Go there without hesitation and bring them to me at my tower near Triboar.

Failure will mean death to your entire clan. After Dead hand and I are done, no one will ever remember the former glory of the Orc War Chief Collective. The forests of your home will run red with blood if you fail.

Â -- Rotten Eye
