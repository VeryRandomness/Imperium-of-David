Jill

On the massive trading vessel The Bishop’s Folly a girl stood at the bow, looking over the sea. This girl had lived her entire life on the ocean learning her family business of sea trading. She often spent months on the water going between the two trade ports or rowing a trade boat to the shore to trade with the smaller settlements. She loved the sea.

“Jill!” Her mother called from the deck, “Come inside dear! It’s going to get dark soon and I don’t want you falling overboard!”

“Coming!” Came Jills reply.

With one last glance towards the ocean she turned towards the cabins at the stern of the boat and made her way past the different ship hands that her parents employed. Over the years growing up on The Bishop’s Folly Jill has meet dozens of these type of men. All of them exceedingly strong, gruff, and loyal to her parents.

“Misses Jill,” Came the gruff voice of John Stewart, the one hired hand that has stayed with the Prace family for years, “if you’s a moment I’d like if you’d take dis note to your parents.” John handed Jill a note.

“Now Mr. Stewart,” Jill started with a smile, “we both know that you talk like a refined gentleman to everyone on this boat, and yet you insist on talking to me in that fake character of yours. Why is that?”

“Well, Misses Jill,” John started in his fake character, “I speaks to you like dis ‘causin I be thinkin you wouln’t be understooding ifin I talk all refined like.”

This was a conversation that Jill and John had multiple times a week. It was a tradition between the two of them. Sometimes John would speak like he didn’t know how to sound refined and sometimes Jill decided to speak like a lesser person. In truth, John was Jill’s teacher when she was younger. He was originally hired to teach Jill on the boat, but since she turned 18 last year he has decided to stay on as a ship hand.

“Will you be joining us for dinner Mr. Stewart?” Jill asked.

“No, Miss Jill.” John answered dropping his fake unrefined persona, “The other hired hands still need help with understanding some of the chemistry I taught them last week, so I will be dining with them this evening.” In addition to working as a ship hand, the Prace family also paid John to teach the hired ship hands topics like history, chemistry, and math in a hope that they will be able to get a less manually taxing job in the future.

“Well, Mr. Stewart, you will be missed tonight. I will make sure my parents get your note.” Jill said as she turned to go to her parents cabin.

“Of course, Miss.” John said smiling as Jill left.

In the Prace Family cabin Richard Prace sat next to his wife Susan Prace eating a simple dinner. Jill sat on the other end of the table. The cabin itself was covered in star charts and different invoices. A large double bed in one corner and a smaller single bed in the other. 

“We should be approaching Nevwiter port in a week or so. We’ll dock their for a few months to find new ship hands and restock. While we are there, we need to visit the collectors office and pay what we owe.” Richard said.

“I just don’t understand why we need to pay taxes when we don’t even live their and only visit a few times a year.” Susan said.

“Our ship is registered with Nevwiter City and so is our trading license, if we don’t pay taxes then we lose the right to dock in Nevwiter and possibly our license. This also means that if Jill ever wanted to leave The Bishop’s Folly she would immediately be granted citizenship in Nevwiter.” Richard responded.

“We don’t need a license to trade. Those caravans don’t have a license and they seem to get along fine without any license.” Susan said.

“You are right, we don’t need a license, but it is definitely worth it. The license deters robbers from attacking us because they know that Nevwiter would know, and they would be hunted. Trust me, if we could just sail these waters without the need for the protection a license provides, we wouldn’t have that license, but marauders are everywhere these days.” Richard said.

This conversation was nothing new to Jill. Her parents had this very debate at least once a month and it never ended with agreement. She has learned to just filter out this common occurrence and enjoy her meal. After her parents finished talking about the need for a license and the pains that accompany it she spoke up.

“Mom, Dad, I was hoping that we could stay in Nevwiter a bit longer than we usually do this time around. I want to look around the area and see all the shops.” She said.

“Sure dear, we just have to be back on the water 3 days after we arrive.” Susan said.

With that Jill finished her dinner and went to bed with a smile on her face.

The Bishop’s Folly arrived in Nevwiter the day before the Star Moon festival and quickly started resupplying their ship. The bustling port of Nevwiter never slept with ships coming and going all day and night. Thousands of people were employed by the dock, with a range of people as diverse as an old elf man employed as a coordinator, to a young dwarven woman making sure the ships were in their right slip. It truly was a magnificent port.

After The Bishop’s Folly finished getting the bulk of their items on board, Jill’s parents let her go out and explore. She went up and down the many streets of Nevwiter, making sure not to stray too far from the boat and staying away from the darker, more sinister looking alleys. She saw shops selling mystical glowing potions that imbue the drinker with greater strength, faster healing, or even brief invisibility, though she didn’t believe the last one worked despite the promises made by the shop keep. Shops with endless swords, armor, and other means of protection, the shop where her families boat was licensed, and shops selling obscure meats.

She spent all of her free time exploring the streets of Nevwiter, hating to go back to the boat every night. She even made friends with the local shop keeps, she always found it easier to talk with adults than children her own age all her life. She thought this was due to the fact that she only ever encountered other children during the short visits to Nevwiter and other port cities, never staying long enough to learn how to talk with other children.

On one of her trips during the last day of her families stay in Nevwiter she wandered down an alley she hadn’t been down before. This alley was obviously older and more worn down. Mold and moss grew on the walls of the buildings that made up the alley. Old decaying trash littered the ground. She usually wouldn’t have gone down this alley but she started to feel that she  wouldn’t get hurt here, and this alley seemed safe, albeit old and dirty. 

As she went further and further into the alley she saw that it terminated at a door with an old sign on it, falling off the bar that held it above the door. The sign read, 

‘Welcome all those brave of heart, to the Adventurers Guild of Nevwiter
Enter to find your fortune’

Steadying herself by taking a breath she pushed the door open and walked inside.

Inside was a large well worn room full of the burliest people she had ever seen. Woman with arms the size of the ship hands her family employed, men with scars running down their entire face. Everyone in the room had tattoos covering their body. As Jill looked closer she realized that all the members had the same tattoo, a diamond with a sword going through it with two arcane looking symbols next to the sword. This, she thought to herself, had to be the tattoo they used to identify people that belonged to the guild.

As she started walking deeper into the room she realized that it was a tavern with the bar at the far side of the room. She walked to the bar and sat next to the most ancient man she had ever seen. His skin was leathery and pulled tight over his boney fingers. He wore an old green traveling cloak and she could see the guild tattoo on his hand was faded by age. He seemed kind and gave off an aura of wisdom.

“Well, aren’t you a little young to be a part of the adventurers guild?” The old man said as she sat down.

“I’m not,” Jill said, “I am just visiting Nevwiter as my family’s ship gets restocked.” Jill responded.

“Ah, you are a Sea Dragon then.” The old man said, a smile coming across his face.

“Yup, my family sails one of the merchant ships, we are heading out tomorrow morning.” Jill said.

“What are you next few ports?” The man asked.

“We are visiting the port cities on the east side of The Dead Sea, ending with Thromp Evenski. We don’t usually go down that far but we got a request for some supplies to be delivered to the town, apparently they weren’t able to grow enough food for the winter and asked if a ship would bring them some.” She said.

“I am friends with a man in Thromp Evenski. A druid that goes by the name of Thomas. It seems fate has brought you here Young Miss Prace.” The old man said to jill, turning as he did so.
This caught Jill off guard, she didn’t remember telling the old man her name.

“Why would you say that?” Jill asked cautiously.

“I have been meaning to deliver something to Thomas for a while now, but none of these ‘Adventurers’ are up to the task, seems they are content with just drinking mead.” The old man said , putting a noticeable amount of emphasis on the word “Adventurers”, drawing out every syllable. “If you are willing, I’d like you to deliver it for me. Don’t worry, I will pay you handsomely.” He said, pulling out a small paper covered package and a bag the clinked when he set it on the table.

Jill was amazed, she couldn’t believe the fact that she came to the tavern when she did, that this man knew her name, or that he had a package that just happened to need to go to a man that lived in a Thromp no one ever visited. 

“How much were you going to pay?” She asked.

“This entire bag full of gold. If you want to count there are around 60 gold pieces in the bag, that should be more than double to cost of shipping, especially since it is on your way. Please promise that you can get it to Thomas before he leaves. I don’t know when he will leave Thromp Evenski, but Fate tells me it is going to be shortly after you arrive there. You must promise me Jill.” He said levelly, looking Jill in the eyes, a slight glow starting to appear around him.

“I promise.” Jill said, a little frightened by the glow.

“Good, good.” The man said. “When you see Thomas, tell him that Aether gave you that package. He’ll understand every else. 

With that, the old man finished his drink and left the bar, disappearing into the crowd.

Jill was in the bow of The Bishop’s Folly, she hadn’t told her parents about the package or the gold she was given for delivering it. Both fit into her day bag which was stored in her families cabin under her bed. The ship was being moved out of port by some wizards using water magic to make sure it didn’t hit any ship or get bashed on the rocks that protected the port.

Jill was still confused about everything that the Aether man had told her. Who was Thomas? What was so important about the package? How did Aether know her name? Why did he speak of fate like it was a human you could have a conversation with? These and many other questions plagued her mind as he family started to sail away from Nevwiter, towards their trade route. No matter what happened, she thought to herself, I need answers from Thomas.

With those thoughts on her mind, she turned towards around and helped make sure the cargo was secure before entering her families quarters for dinner.
