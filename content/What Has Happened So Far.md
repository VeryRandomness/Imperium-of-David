[[1) The Start]]
As you were traveling down Saratoga Rd. in Jacks Jeep Grand Cherokee, you hit something big and furry causing you to spin out. You then went through a portal that teleported you to a fantasy world.

You saw smoke in the distance and decided to drive the car to where the smoke was coming from. Arriving where the smoke emanated from you realized it was a small collection of buildings called [[Stathford]]. Going to the inn, you attempted to buy some food but had no money it was as this point you met [[David son of David]]. The town blacksmith came bursting through the door and asked you to go save his daughter.

[[2) The Goblins Crime]]
You went to where the Gloomshank tribe had their lair and fought your way through them. You found the blacksmiths daughter about to be sacrificed by a Hobgoblin Shaman. After killing the Shaman a wind swept through the air that sounded vaguely like a scream of anger. You also found the [[Note from Dead Hand]].

[[3) Longsaddle and Surrounding Area]]
On your journey to [[Longsaddle]] you had to cross a river. You also ran into a group of Goblins and a Bugbear that, after killing, revealed there was a bounty ([[The Bounty]]) on your heads.

In [[Longsaddle]] Proper you sought after [[Heldspar Gunth]] to collect your reward for killing goblins and such. He invited you over for dinner and told you to investigate his home to prove that he was not the person killing people. It turns out that his Great Great Great Great Great Grandfather who was a vampire. You also were given a quest from [[Halaema Glavien (Jacks Mom)]] to retrive a stolen family artifact. This took you to the black markets north of [[Longsaddle]].

You stayed in Longsaddle for a while, becoming friendly with the towns people. 5 Orcs came to town one day and said they were there to collect you. After killing them you found [[Rotten Eye's Command]] on their bodies.

[[4) Traveling to Triboar]]
On your way to [[Triboar]] you had two different run ins with very interesting people. The first was with [[The Gypsies]] who let you stay with them for the night and were gone without a trace the next morning. The next person was the [[Fortune Teller]] who gave you [[The Fortune]]. As you got closer to [[Triboar]] you saw smoke rising into the air. When you arrived you saw the town was on fire.
